**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates House Price Prediction using Linear Regression. The dataset (houseprice.csv) contains information about the number of floors in a house and its corresponding price. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on the number of floors.

The project is implemented in two ways:

Using Scikit-Learn’s Linear Regression

Using a manual Gradient Descent algorithm

**Features**

Data preprocessing and normalization

Train-test data splitting

Linear Regression using sklearn

Gradient Descent implementation from scratch

Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score

Data visualization with regression line

Predict house price for a given number of floors

**Technologies Used**

Python

NumPy → numerical operations

Pandas → data handling

Matplotlib → data visualization

Scikit-Learn → regression & evaluation metrics


**Workflow**

Load and explore dataset

Preprocess and normalize features

Train a Linear Regression model (Scikit-Learn)

Evaluate model performance (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)

Implement Gradient Descent from scratch

Visualize regression line with scatter plot

Predict price for new input (e.g., 2 floors)
